# Privacy Policy for jpegWiz

**Last Updated:** July 20, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how jpegWiz ("the App") collects, uses, and handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring a secure experience.

## 1. Data We Do Not Collect or Store

jpegWiz is designed with your privacy in mind. We want to be clear about what we **do not** do:

*   **No Cloud Processing of Your Images/PDFs:** All image to PDF and PDF to image conversions are performed **locally on your device**. Your photos and documents are never sent to our servers or any third-party servers for processing. This ensures your sensitive data remains private and secure on your device.
*   **No User Accounts or Personal Identifiable Information (PII) Collection:** The App does not require you to create an account or provide any personal information such as your name, email address (unless you choose to send feedback), or location. We do not collect or store any data that directly identifies you.

## 2. Information We Collect (Anonymous & Limited)

While we prioritize your privacy, certain limited, non-personally identifiable information is collected to improve the App's functionality, analyze usage, and manage subscriptions. This data is primarily anonymous and aggregated.

### a. Analytics Data (via Firebase)

We use Google Firebase to collect anonymous usage data. This helps us understand how the App is used, identify popular features, and improve performance. The data collected by Firebase is aggregated and does not identify you personally. Examples of data collected include:

*   **Device Information:** Device model, operating system version.
*   **App Usage Data:** Features used, session duration, crashes, and performance data.
*   **Anonymous Identifiers:** Installation UUIDs (unique to your app installation, not linked to your personal identity).

For more information on Firebase's privacy practices, please refer to Google's Privacy Policy: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

### b. Purchase and Subscription Data (via RevenueCat)

We use RevenueCat to manage in-app purchases and subscriptions. RevenueCat processes transaction data related to your subscriptions (e.g., subscription status, purchase date, renewal date). This data is linked to an anonymous user ID generated by RevenueCat and is not directly linked to your personal identity. This allows us to verify your subscription status and provide the correct features (e.g., removing watermarks for premium users).

For more information on RevenueCat's privacy practices, please refer to RevenueCat's Privacy Policy: [https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy)

### c. Feedback Mail (User-Initiated)

If you choose to send us feedback via email through the App, your email address and any information you include in your message will be collected. This information is used solely to respond to your inquiry and improve the App. We will not use your email address for marketing purposes unless you explicitly opt-in.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected anonymous and limited data for the following purposes:

*   **To Operate and Maintain the App:** Ensuring the App functions correctly and providing you with its features.
*   **To Improve the App:** Analyzing usage patterns to enhance user experience, fix bugs, and develop new features.
*   **To Manage Subscriptions:** Verifying premium features (like watermark removal) and managing your subscription status.
*   **To Respond to Feedback:** Addressing your questions and concerns when you contact us.

## 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not share any personally identifiable information with third parties. Anonymous and aggregated data collected via Firebase and RevenueCat may be shared with these service providers for the purposes described above. We will not sell your data.

We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect and defend our rights or property, or protect the personal safety of users of the App or the public.

## 5. Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect the information we collect. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## 6. Your Choices and Rights

*   **Access to Gallery:** The App requires access to your device's photo gallery to select images for conversion. This access is **local only**; images are processed on your device and are not uploaded to any external server.
*   **Watermarks:** For users on a free account, the App may add a watermark to converted PDFs. This is a feature of the free version and is removed upon subscription to a premium plan.
*   **Opt-Out of Analytics:** While Firebase data is anonymous, you may be able to limit data collection through your device's privacy settings. Please refer to your device's documentation for more information.

## 7. Children's Privacy

jpegWiz is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
